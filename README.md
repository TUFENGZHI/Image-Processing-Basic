## Image Compression
Image compression schemes aim to decrease the number of bits used to represent the image. Using fewer bits allows the image to take up less storage space on a computer, and it can also be transmitted faster (over a network, via satellite, etc.).
The goal of this part is to look at the effect of compression that we do ourselves by implementing a gray- scale JPEG compression.

## Richardson-Lucy Deconvolution
The Richardson–Lucy algorithm, also known as Lucy–Richardson deconvolution, is an iterative procedure for recovering a latent image that has been blurred by a known point spread function (PSF). It was named after William Richardson and Leon Lucy, who described it independently.

## Harris Corner Detection
Harris corner detection algorithm is used for detecting corner in the image. It considers the corner point with respect to both vertical and horizontal direction.

## Bilateral Filter
Bilateral filter is a non-linear, edge-preserving filter to smooth images.
